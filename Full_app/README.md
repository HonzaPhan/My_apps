# App with routing
This project centers around implementing routing and gaining experience with React, TypeScript, and APIs.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

How to run the app locally:

1. Run ```npm install``` to install all needed dependencies.
2. Go to [OpenWeatherMap's ](http://openweathermap.org/) and get a free API key. Open file ```App.tsx``` and rewrite the key.
3. If you don't have webpack installed on your machine, run ```npm install webpack -g```.
4. Open up two command prompts. In one, run ```webpack -w```. This lets webpack watch for changes to your files. After any saved changes, webpack automatically runs and updates your ```bundle.js``` file.
5. In the other command prompt run ```npm start``` or ```node server.js```. These commands do the same thing: Starting your server to host the web app.
6. Navigate to ```localhost:3000``` to see the app in action
